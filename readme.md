# Basic Programming Language Interpreter

This project is a simple interpreter for a basic programming language inspired by BASIC. It allows you to write and execute simple programs with commands like `print`, `input`, `let`, `if`, `goto`, and more.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-interpreter.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd basic-interpreter
    ```
3. Run the interpreter:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

Once you run the interpreter, you can use the following commands:

- `print`: Print a message (e.g., `print 'Hello, World!'`).
- `input`: Get input from the user (e.g., `let name = input 'What is your name'`).
- `let`: Assign a value to a variable (e.g., `let x = 10`).
- `if`: Conditional statement (e.g., `if x > 10 then print 'x is greater than 10'`).
- `goto`: Jump to a specific line (e.g., `goto 10`).
- `end`: End the program.
- `list`: List all the commands.
- `run`: Run the program.
- `clear`: Clear the screen.
- `save`: Save the program.
- `load`: Load the program.
- `new`: Start a new program.
- `edit`: Edit the program.
- `delete`: Delete the program.
- `quit`: Exit the program.
